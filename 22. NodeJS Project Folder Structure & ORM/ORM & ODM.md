# Object Relational Mapping (ORM) 

It is a technique used in creating a "bridge" between object-oriented programs and, in most cases, relational databases. ORM as the layer that connects object oriented programming (OOP) to relational databases. 
When interacting with a database using OOP languages, you'll have to perform different operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting (CRUD) data from a database. By design, you use SQL for performing these operations in relational databases.

While using SQL for this purpose isn't necessarily a bad idea, the ORM and ORM tools help simplify the interaction between relational databases and different OOP languages.
eg. of ORM is Sequelize 

# Object Document Mapping (ODM)

ODM on the other hand is an Object Document Mapper, which maps objects with a Document Database like MongoDB. The main difference is that ORM is for MySQL databases, while ODM does the mapping for document representation of data. 
eg. of ODM is Mongoose
