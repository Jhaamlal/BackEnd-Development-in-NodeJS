- **Client** -> Any end system (Mobile phones, Laptops, PCs) that actually initiates a request is considered a  client. It wants to query some information. The client can be any computer that requests something from the server. For example – visiting any website we request the webpage from its domain. So here we act as a client.

- **Server** -> Servers collect these requests from clients. An end system (DB, Computer) that actually receives a request processes the request, extracts some data from it, and sends that data to the client. For the same example as above, the client asks for the webpage then the server responds with the webpage to the client.
