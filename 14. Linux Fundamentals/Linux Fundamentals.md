**Qs. What is UNIX like OS?**

An operating system is said to be Unix-based or Unix-like if it's designed to function and behave similar to the Unix operating system. Examples of proprietary Unix-like operating systems include AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, and Tru64. Examples of open-source Unix-like operating systems are those based on the Linux kernel and BSD derivatives, such as FreeBSD and OpenBSD. Linux is not Unix, but it is a Unix-like operating system. Linux system is derived from Unix and it is a continuation of the basis of Unix design. Linux distributions are the most famous and healthiest example of direct Unix derivatives.
