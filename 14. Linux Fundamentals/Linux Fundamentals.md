**Qs. What is UNIX like OS?**

An operating system is said to be Unix-based or Unix-like if it's designed to function and behave similar to the Unix operating system. Examples of proprietary Unix-like operating systems include AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, and Tru64. Examples of open-source Unix-like operating systems are those based on the Linux kernel and BSD derivatives, such as FreeBSD and OpenBSD. Linux is not Unix, but it is a Unix-like operating system. Linux system is derived from Unix and it is a continuation of the basis of Unix design. Linux distributions are the most famous and healthiest example of direct Unix derivatives. 

**Qs. Why Linux?**
1. Itâ€™s free
2. Open source software
3. Security
4. Stability
5. Easy to maintain
6. Runs on any hardware
7. Easy to use
8. Customizable
 
A **Linux distribution** (often abbreviated as distro) is an operating system made from a software collection that includes the Linux kernel, and often a package management system. eg. Ubuntu is a Linux distro. Ubuntu is not Linux. Ubuntu is based on Linux.

A *Shell script* is a computer program designed to be run by a Unix shell, a command-line interpreter. The various dialects of shell scripts are considered to be scripting languages. Typical operations performed by shell scripts include file manipulation, program execution, and printing text.
Whatever Linux command that we will learn are actually a part of a bigger ecosystem called shell scripts.

**REPL => Read Evalualte Print Loop**

NodeJS, Python, the Bash shell, and the developer console found in most web browsers are REPL consoles.
The read-eval-print-loop (REPL) console is a convenient way to do simple programming, test out things, and experiment. As the name implies, the REPL repeatedly (in a infinite loop) prints out a prompt, reads an input command, evaluates it, then prints the result.

For any linux command u can actually check the usage and different input flags it expects by running the command followed by `--help`. 

- `pwd` -> The pwd command writes to standard output the full path name of your current directory (from the root directory). All directories are separated by a / (slash). The root directory is represented by the first /, and the last directory named is your current directory.

- `cd <path>` -> The cd command in Linux stands for change directory. It is used to change the current directory of the terminal. The terminal, by default, opens the home directory. 

- `cd ..` -> The cd .. command in Linux shift one level above the current directory, we input .. as the argument.

- `cd ../..` -> The cd ../.. command in Linux shift two levels above the current directory, we input ../.. as the argument.

- `cd ~` -> This cd ~ command will help u to directly come back to the Home directory.
